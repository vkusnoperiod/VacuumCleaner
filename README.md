# VacuumCleaner
## Description
My first telegram-bot that for now is as simple as it gets.
Stay tuned.
## How to install 
Well, firstly u need to install all the dependencies required.
### macOS
`brew install gcc cmake boost openssl zlib curl`
## Execution 
Copy repository and do some edits in your CMakeLists.txt file:
Change directory from default to directory where u installed your dependencies(libraries).
From that point on your bot should execute.
